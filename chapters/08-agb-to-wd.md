# Chapter 8: From Asymptotic Giant Branch to White Dwarf

## Introduction

The final stages of evolution for low‑mass stars (M ≲ 8 M☉) are a spectacular demonstration of stellar physics. After exhausting helium in the core, a star ascends the **asymptotic giant branch (AGB)**, where it undergoes dramatic mass loss, ejects its outer layers as a glowing **planetary nebula**, and finally exposes its hot, degenerate core—a **white dwarf**. This chapter traces the journey of a Sun‑like star from the AGB to its ultimate fate as a cold, dark **black dwarf**.

## 8.1 The Asymptotic Giant Branch and Helium‑Shell Flashes

On the AGB the star possesses a degenerate carbon–oxygen core surrounded by a helium‑burning shell and an outer hydrogen‑burning shell. Because the helium‑burning shell is thin and thermally unstable, it experiences recurrent **thermal pulses** (helium‑shell flashes). During a flash, the shell luminosity rises sharply, causing the outer envelope to expand and cool temporarily. After each flash the shell returns to steady helium burning, and the star slowly brightens again.

These flashes drive **dredge‑up** episodes that bring freshly synthesized carbon and s‑process elements to the surface, enriching the stellar wind with heavy elements.

## 8.2 Extreme Mass Loss and Stellar Winds

The most distinctive feature of the AGB phase is **extreme mass loss**. Radiation pressure on dust grains that condense in the cool, extended atmosphere drives a slow (∼10–30 km s⁻¹) but dense wind, removing 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁴ M☉ yr⁻¹. Over a few hundred thousand years the star can shed more than half its initial mass.

This mass loss is crucial: it strips away the hydrogen‑rich envelope, eventually uncovering the hot core. Without such mass loss the star would remain on the AGB indefinitely.

## 8.3 Ejection and Illumination of a Planetary Nebula

When the mass‑loss rate peaks, the star ejects its outer layers in a series of episodic outflows. The exposed core, now heating up to >30 000 K, emits copious ultraviolet radiation that ionizes the ejected material. The ionized gas fluoresces, producing the magnificent, often symmetric structures we observe as **planetary nebulae**.

Despite the name, planetary nebulae have nothing to do with planets; they are the glowing shrouds of dying stars. Well‑known examples include the Ring Nebula (M57), the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), and the Cat’s Eye Nebula (NGC 6543).

## 8.4 Birth of a White Dwarf

Once the envelope is completely ejected, the remnant is the degenerate carbon–oxygen core, now a **white dwarf**. It is supported by electron‑degeneracy pressure, has a mass typically between 0.5 and 1.4 M☉, and a radius comparable to that of Earth (∼10⁴ km). Because nuclear burning has ceased, the white dwarf shines only by residual thermal energy.

The **initial white‑dwarf temperature** can exceed 100 000 K, making it a strong source of far‑ultraviolet and soft X‑ray radiation.

## 8.5 The White‑Dwarf Cooling Track

With no internal energy source, a white dwarf cools monotonically over billions of years. Its luminosity follows the approximate relation

\[
L \propto T_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3.5} \, t^{-1.2},
\]

where \(t\) is the cooling age. As it cools, the star moves down and to the right on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, eventually becoming too faint to detect.

After ∼10¹⁰ years the white dwarf cools to a temperature below a few thousand kelvins, becoming a **black dwarf**—a cold, inert sphere of crystallized carbon and oxygen. Because the Universe is only 13.8 billion years old, no black dwarfs are expected to exist yet.

## 8.6 Observational Signatures

- **AGB stars**: Identified by their large infrared excess (dust emission) and characteristic spectral features (e.g., TiO bands, CO lines).
- **Planetary nebulae**: Recognized by their bright emission lines (Hα, [O III], [N II]) and often intricate morphologies.
- **White dwarfs**: Detected through their high proper motions, blue colors (for young, hot ones), and broad hydrogen or helium absorption lines (DA or DB spectral types).

## 8.7 Summary

The transition from the AGB to a white dwarf is a brief but brilliant finale for low‑mass stars. Through helium‑shell flashes, prodigious mass loss, and the ejection of a planetary nebula, the star sheds its envelope and leaves behind a dense, Earth‑sized ember that will slowly fade into darkness over cosmic time. Understanding this phase provides key insights into the chemical enrichment of galaxies, the origin of planetary nebulae, and the ultimate fate of the vast majority of stars in the Universe.
